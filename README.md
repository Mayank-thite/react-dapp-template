# React Dapp Quickstart Template
This is a quickstart template for those who want to quickly get started with developing a React Dapp without the need of formatting and playing around with the example template provided by `$ truffle unbox react`.

####This template includes the following:
+ React 17.0.2
+ Truffle
+ Solidity 8.0.3
+ Web3.js
+ OpenZeppelin Library
+ Basic ERC-20 Smart Contract with mint, burn and balanceOf functions integrated into the front-end

#####Dependencies
+ NodeJs
+ Truffle
+ Ganache (optional, you can change this in truffle-config)
+ Metamask or any other ethereum wallet provider

###How to run this?
+ Download the zip and extract it
+ Open the project folder in a terminal
+ Do `$ npm install` in **root** of the project as well as in ***/client* **to get all dependencies
+ Open a new Ethereum workspace in Ganache
+ Go back to your terminal and then enter `$ truffle migrate` to compile our Smart Contracts and get their ABI files
+ Add Ganache in your MetaMask networks and import your Ethereum account in it
+ Go to **client** folder and do `$ npm run start`

##### Hope you were able to run it without any errors! :)

This template was created to help out new developers that are just entering the solidity dapp development and have very little knowledge about creating projects with truffle and React. Its nowhere near a beautiful application or a very function rich experience.

#####Remember, this is just a blank drawing board for you to start off with!
